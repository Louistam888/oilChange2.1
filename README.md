# oilChange2.1
Vanilla javascript remake of oil change app

Since the pandemic began, many of us have been driving less and are less in touch with the maintenance schedules of our cars. 
For those who do their own oil changes (and don't get oil change reminder stickers on their windshields), this app calculates 
when the next oil change is likely due. 

Built with: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
